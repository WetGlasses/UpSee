# UpSee-Tipsy
6D Robotic ARM Controller with UP-Camera based Vision

## Implemented:  

### Vision:  

1. UP-Camera calibration.  
2. Distortion Correction.  
3. Perspective correction.  
4. Color conversion, Thresholding, Masking, Contouring.  
5. Color based Object detection.   
6. Object localization. (In real-world)  


### Manipulator:  

1. Lower-level servo control using arduino.  
2. Forward kinematics.  
3. A very basic greedy, slow, Inverse kinematics.
